####################################
Changes in version 0.10 8/8/2004

New features:
1. Implemented the Mode Scan dialog.

Bug fixes:
1. Fixed bug that prevented program from exiting.  It *looked* like the 
   program exited, but it was running the background without a window.
   When this occurred the com port was still open so it prevented other
   programs (including another copy of the Xcat control program) from opening
   the com port.
