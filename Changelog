Changes in version 0.20 7/15/2007
1. Added support for digital squelch pot connected to user function outputs.
2. Modified code to allow the PC baudrate to be changed even if communications
   with the Xcat fails.  Previously the PC baudrate was only changed after
   an ACK was received from the Xcat for the new baudrate, this made it
   very difficult to sync baudrates under certain conditions.
3. Added checks for firmware features against Xcat firmware version when
   setting a new configuration.  Configurations that select feature that
   are not supported by a particular firmware release are not longer allowed.

Changes in version 0.19 2/9/2007

Removed some left over debug code from 0.18 and bumped version number
for release.

####################################
Changes in version 0.18 1/19/2007 (limited beta release)

Bug fixes:
1. Corrected several bugs in the internal code plug data decoding introduced 
   in version 0.17 which caused the transmit offset to be set to "Receive only"
   a frequency was set.
   
2. Corrected rounding errors in calculation of transmit offset frequency from
   code plug read back.
   
Thanks to Tim WD6AWP for reporting the bugs and help testing the fixes.

####################################
Changes in version 0.17 1/2/2007

New features:
1. Added support for DPL (DCS) encoding and decoding to the VFO page.
2. Added a DPL scan option to Scan page. 
3. Added support for UHF range 1 radios (420).  Updated Xcat Firmware required.
4. Added receive only support to the VFO page.  Receive only is now offered
   as a choice in the transmitter offset box.
5. Added support for the transmitter timeout timer to the VFO page.
6. Added code to save retrieved code plug data to c:\xcat.bin when the code
   plug data is read via the Debug Page.
7. Enabled VCO split frequencies to be specified for UHF range radios. Updated 
   Xcat Firmware is required.
8. Corrected the default value of the receive VCO split frequency for VHF range
   2 radios (was 215.9, should be 203.9).

The DPL support is lightly tested.  There is some uncertainty about that correct
value for 3 of the bits that make up the programming information for each code.
Thanks to Andy Brinkley NC4AB DPL codes 023 to 223 match the values generated
by the official Motorola suit case programmer.  The remaining codes may or may 
not work with other than Motorola equipment or Yeasu VX-5R used by Dennis 
KB8ZQZ to empirically determine working values.  The Xcat control program will 
be updated as more information becomes available.

Support for 420 Mhz and UHF VCO split frequencies was added in version 0.23 
of the Xcat firmware which has not been released yet. Please contact me if 
you would like to help test these new features.

####################################
Changes in version 0.16 2/11/2005 (limited beta release)

Minor enhancements: 
1. Added display of new serial frame size debug variable in debug page.

####################################
Changes in version 0.15 1/8/2005

New features:
1. Added the ability to label modes by name.
2. Added the ability to save and restore label name to the configuration
   page.
3. The VFO page now sets the initial dialog values based on code plug
   data read from the Xcat.
4. A recall mode button was added to the VFO page.
5. The ability to set the Xcat's CI-V address and baudrate was added. 
   (Requires Xcat firmware 0.13 or later)

####################################
Changes in version 0.14 12/31/2004 (limited beta release)

Minor enhancements: 
1. Disabled signal reports in debug page.
2. Added display of successfully rx, tx frequency sets to sync data
   debug page.

####################################
Changes in version 0.13 12/27/2004 (limited beta release)

Minor enhancements: 
1. Added support for sync rx debug data (requires firmware update as well).
2. Added request buttons to Debug mode for code plug data and sync rx
   debug data.

Bug fixes:
1. Fixed crash in Debug mode which occured when mode data was read.
2. Corrected bug in configuration of Palomar remote base #4.

####################################
Changes in version 0.12 8/28/2004

New features:
1. Added the ability to change the serial port baudrate and the address used
   by the Xcat on the bus.

####################################
Changes in version 0.11 never released

####################################
Changes in version 0.10 8/8/2004

New features:
1. Implemented the Mode Scan dialog.

Bug fixes:
1. Fixed bug that prevented program from exiting.  It *looked* like the 
   program exited, but it was running the background without a window.
   When this occurred the com port was still open so it prevented other
   programs (including another copy of the Xcat control program) from opening
   the com port.
